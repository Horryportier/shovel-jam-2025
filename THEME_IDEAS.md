# IDEA DUMP

### SudOku's Ideas

1. you start as a black shape (circle or square) in a dark empty world. at first you can only move and do short jumps. then you get legs and can jump farther, later arms which let you swing using elastic movement. as you gain more body parts, levels get harder and more mechanics are added like enemies, hazards, and platforming. the world also slowly gets more detailed and alive. whole game builds up step by step, matching the theme “getting started”.


### Horry's Ideas
1. crafting game with time constrain like (1 hour one life)
    issues: 
        how to make  it work in signle player?
2. subway surfer like where yor try to get to the goal which is thing you want to start 
    but you get interupted by verious things on the way toward your goal.
    we could use sprite stacknig for assets
