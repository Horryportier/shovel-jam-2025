# Theme (Just Get Started!)
**WATCH THIS FIRST** [theme video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIL2wgHvgxU&t)
ya i also have no idea how to iterprate this.

## folder structure 
- addons/
    don't know if we need it but if we will use any they go here 
- assets/
    all the art goes here probably i will acually use it the most tho 
- assets/audio/
    if we get any in time lol
- autoload/
    every  script/scene that an `autoload` goes here
- exports/
    evrything will be exported here i will export it using `butler` so we get itch updates **automated**
- resources/
    everything thats and resource meaning file ends with `.tres` or an shader goes here 
- scenes/
    every `.tscn` file goes here make seperete folders for stuf like map or player just keep it clean enought
- scripts/
    every `.gd` file thats not connected to scene goes here
    so if you attack scrpit to scene it sohuld go to the same folder as that scene.
    this is **only** for new classes

## naming preferences
> i'm not gonna kill you if you don't follow them but i won't be happy 

- values = snake_case 
- calsses = PascalCase
- node names = PascalCase
- functions = snake_case
- internal funcitions = prrefix with `_` (underscore
- external functions = no prefix
- signal functions = prefix with `_on_`

## other 
- placeholder art == godot icon (don't downland any werid assets its an Licence nightmare)
- git conflicts - its better if we don't touch others work till we finish our task alto we will see how bad it will be
